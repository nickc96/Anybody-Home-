Anybody Home?
By Nicholas Chin
Inspired by Lost Pig


This story is about a person who gets stuck at the bottom of a well. The bottom of the well opens up into a cavernous area. You play as that person and wander around to find a way out. Joined with you is a duck that you name Bill. As you travel, you note that the rooms make you feel like someone is living in this place. Are you truly alone? Is anybody home?

The locked room part of this puzzle is encountered twice. One time, you need to find a key in one of the rooms that allows you to access a secret room, not available without the key. I didn't make you need to use the key. Instead, everytime you enter the room, it checks if you are holding the key and if you are, then the path opens up. The other locked room part is at the very end and actually determines if you get a bad ending or good ending in the story. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I'm not going to detail it here. If you played the game already and want to know, though, email me at nchin@villanova.edu!


Hope you enjoy the story!
